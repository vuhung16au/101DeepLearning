% Chapter 13: Linear Factor Models

\chapter{Linear Factor Models}
\label{chap:linear-factor-models}

This chapter introduces probabilistic models with linear structure, which form the foundation for many unsupervised learning methods.

After studying this chapter, you will be able to:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Explain probabilistic PCA and factor analysis and their relationships to PCA.
    \item Derive EM updates for latent variable models with linear-Gaussian structure.
    \item Compare identifiability and rotation issues in factor models.
    \item Connect linear latent models to modern representation learning.
\end{enumerate}



\section*{Intuition}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Intuition}

Linear factor models posit a small set of hidden sources generating observed data through linear mixing plus noise. The learning problem is to recover those hidden coordinates that best explain variance while respecting uncertainty.
