\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em]
    \item \textbf{Domain-specific applications}: Deep learning has transformed computer vision, NLP, speech recognition, healthcare, and reinforcement learning, with each domain requiring specialized architectures and approaches tailored to specific data types and constraints.
    \item \textbf{Real-world impact}: Applications span from entertainment and gaming to critical infrastructure and safety systems, demonstrating the versatility of deep learning across diverse industries including finance, scientific research, agriculture, and manufacturing.
    \item \textbf{Systematic approach}: Successful applications require understanding the fundamental characteristics of each domain, including data assumptions, evaluation metrics, and deployment considerations, before selecting appropriate model families and training strategies.
    \item \textbf{Ethical responsibility}: As deep learning systems become more powerful and widely deployed, addressing bias, privacy, transparency, security, job displacement, and environmental impact becomes crucial for responsible AI development.
    \item \textbf{Practical constraints}: Real-world success depends on balancing technical sophistication with practical constraints, often achieving better results through careful problem formulation and data understanding than through complex model architectures.
