\section*{Intuition}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Intuition}

Practical deep learning succeeds when we reduce uncertainty early and iterate quickly. Start with \emph{simple, auditable baselines} to validate data and objectives, then progressively add complexity only when it measurably helps. Prefer experiments that answer the biggest unknowns first (e.g., data quality vs. model capacity). Treat metrics, validation splits, and ablations as your instrumentation layer; they convert intuition into evidence. See also \textcite{GoodfellowEtAl2016} for methodology patterns.
