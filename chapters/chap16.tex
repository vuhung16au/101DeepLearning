Graphical structure encodes assumptions about which variables interact, where neural components capture complex local relationships while the graph constrains global behavior, aiding data efficiency and interpretability. For example, in medical diagnosis, a graphical model can encode the causal relationships between symptoms, diseases, and treatments, where neural networks learn complex patterns in individual symptoms while the graph structure ensures that the diagnosis follows logical medical reasoning. A graphical model is like a city's traffic system, where the neural networks are the individual vehicles that can navigate complex local routes, while the graph structure provides the overall traffic rules and road network that ensures efficient and logical flow throughout the entire system.
