\section{What is Deep Learning? \difficultyInline{beginner}}
\label{sec:what-is-dl}

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on learning hierarchical representations of data through artificial \gls{neural-network}s with multiple layers. These networks, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, have revolutionized numerous fields including \gls{computer-vision}, \gls{natural-language-processing}, speech recognition, and many others.

\begin{remark}[What is "Deep" in Deep Learning?]
The term "deep" refers to neural networks with multiple hidden layers (typically 3 or more), where each layer learns increasingly abstract representations from the previous layer's output. In contrast, "shallow" networks have only one or two hidden layers and are limited in their ability to learn complex hierarchical patterns, making deep networks essential for solving sophisticated problems that require understanding of multi-level features and relationships.
\end{remark}

\subsection{The Rise of Deep Learning}

The resurgence of neural networks, now known as deep learning, represents one of the most significant technological revolutions of the 21st century, transforming how we approach complex problems across virtually every domain of human endeavor. This remarkable comeback was not the result of a single breakthrough, but rather the convergence of multiple enabling factors that created the perfect storm for artificial intelligence advancement. The digital age has produced unprecedented amounts of data, providing the essential fuel needed to train increasingly complex models that can learn sophisticated patterns and representations. Simultaneously, the advent of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and specialized hardware has enabled the training of networks with millions or even billions of parameters, making previously impossible computational tasks not only feasible but practical for widespread deployment.

\subsection{Key Characteristics}

Deep learning fundamentally differs from traditional machine learning approaches through its ability to automatically discover and learn complex hierarchical representations directly from raw data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering that has long been a bottleneck in machine learning applications. Unlike traditional methods that require domain experts to carefully design and select relevant features, deep learning models automatically learn multiple levels of representation, progressing from simple low-level features like edges and textures in images to increasingly abstract high-level concepts like object categories and semantic relationships. This hierarchical learning process mirrors how the human brain processes information, enabling deep networks to capture intricate patterns and dependencies that would be extremely difficult or impossible to engineer manually. The end-to-end learning paradigm allows entire systems to be trained jointly rather than in separate stages, creating more coherent and optimized solutions that can adapt to the specific requirements of complex tasks. Perhaps most importantly, deep learning models demonstrate remarkable scalability, continuing to improve their performance as more data and computational resources become available, making them particularly well-suited for the data-rich environments of modern applications.

\subsection{Applications}

Deep learning has achieved remarkable success across an astonishingly diverse range of domains, fundamentally transforming how we approach complex problems and creating entirely new possibilities for human-computer interaction. In computer vision, deep learning has revolutionized image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, facial recognition, and image generation, enabling applications from autonomous vehicles that can navigate complex environments to medical imaging systems that can detect diseases with superhuman accuracy. Natural language processing has been completely transformed by deep learning, with machine translation systems that can translate between languages in real-time, sentiment analysis tools that can understand emotional context in text, question-answering systems that can provide accurate responses to complex queries, and text generation models that can create coherent and contextually appropriate content. Speech and audio applications have reached new heights with speech recognition systems that can understand natural conversation, speaker identification technologies that can distinguish between individuals, music generation systems that can create original compositions, and audio synthesis tools that can produce realistic human speech. Healthcare has been particularly revolutionized by deep learning, with medical image analysis systems that can detect cancer and other diseases from X-rays and MRI scans, drug discovery platforms that can identify promising compounds, disease prediction models that can assess patient risk, and personalized medicine approaches that can tailor treatments to individual patients. Robotics applications have advanced dramatically with autonomous navigation systems that can operate in complex environments, manipulation systems that can perform delicate tasks, and decision-making algorithms that can adapt to changing conditions. Game playing has reached new frontiers with systems that have achieved superhuman performance in complex games like Go, Chess, and video games, demonstrating the power of deep learning to master strategic thinking and long-term planning. The impact of deep learning extends far beyond these applications, touching virtually every aspect of modern technology and scientific research, from climate modeling and financial analysis to space exploration and materials science.
