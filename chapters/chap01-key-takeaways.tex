\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em]
    \item \textbf{Deep learning} is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations.
    \item \textbf{Historical milestones} include the perceptron (1950s), backpropagation (1980s), and the deep learning renaissance (2010s) enabled by data, compute, and algorithms.
    \item \textbf{Key success factors} include large datasets, GPU acceleration, improved algorithms, and better understanding of training dynamics.
    \item \textbf{Major applications} span computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, game playing, and scientific discovery.
    \item \textbf{Limitations exist}: Deep learning requires substantial data and compute, can be brittle to distribution shifts, and lacks interpretability.
