After studying this chapter, you will be able to:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify opportunities where deep learning provides value in vision, language, speech, and tabular domains.
    \item Select appropriate model families and data representations for each application area.
    \item Design evaluation protocols and metrics suited to each task type.
    \item Recognize common failure modes and deployment considerations across applications.
\end{enumerate}



\section*{Intuition}

Applications differ not only in architectures but in \emph{data assumptions and metrics}. A robust recipe is: clarify the task and loss, understand the data distribution and constraints, then choose the simplest model that can plausibly meet the requirements before scaling up.
