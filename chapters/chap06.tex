% Chapter 6: Deep Feedforward Networks

\chapter{Deep Feedforward Networks}
\label{chap:feedforward-networks}

This chapter introduces deep feedforward neural networks, also known as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). These are the fundamental building blocks of deep learning.

\begin{learningobjectives}
\objective{The architecture of feedforward neural networks and how they process information from input to output}
\objective{Activation functions and their role in introducing non-linearity, including the trade-offs between different choices}
\objective{Appropriate output layers and loss functions for different types of machine learning tasks (regression, binary classification, multiclass classification)}
\objective{And implement backpropagation to efficiently compute gradients for training neural networks}
\objective{Informed design choices about network architecture, initialization, and training procedures}
\objective{Theoretical knowledge to solve practical problems involving feedforward networks}
\end{learningobjectives}
