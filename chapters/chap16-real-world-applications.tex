\label{sec:structured-prob-real-world}


Structured probabilistic models capture dependencies and uncertainties in complex systems. These models enable reasoning under uncertainty and provide principled frameworks for decision-making in real-world applications.

\subsection{Autonomous Vehicle Decision Making}

Autonomous vehicle decision making requires reasoning about uncertainties in complex environments, where predicting pedestrian behavior involves capturing uncertainty about pedestrian intentions based on their position, posture, and gaze direction, enabling the vehicle to make conservative decisions by slowing down when a pedestrian might cross rather than assuming they won't. Sensor fusion with uncertainty combines cameras, radar, and lidar data using probabilistic graphical models that weigh each sensor according to reliability in current conditions, where cameras work poorly in fog while radar penetrates fog better, providing robust perception despite individual sensor limitations. Planning under uncertainty involves route planning that considers uncertain travel times due to traffic, weather, and road conditions, where structured probabilistic models help vehicles balance expected arrival time with reliability and provide realistic time estimates.

\subsection{Medical Diagnosis and Treatment}

Medical diagnosis and treatment require careful uncertainty quantification, where Bayesian diagnosis systems handle the uncertainty inherent in medical diagnosis by encoding relationships between symptoms, diseases, and test results using structured probabilistic models that compute probability distributions over possible diagnoses, helping doctors order appropriate tests and consider differential diagnoses systematically. Personalized treatment planning uses probabilistic models that integrate genetic markers, tumor characteristics, and treatment histories to estimate probability distributions over treatment outcomes, where doctors use these estimates to discuss risks and benefits with patients, enabling informed shared decisions about treatment options. Drug interaction modeling addresses the risks faced by patients taking multiple medications by using structured models that capture dependencies between drugs while considering individual patient factors like age, kidney function, and genetics to estimate risk probabilities, enabling safer prescribing especially for elderly patients on many medications.

\subsection{Natural Language Understanding}

Natural language understanding involves handling the inherent ambiguity and structure of language, where machine translation quality uses probabilistic models to capture ambiguity in words that have multiple possible translations depending on context, with structured models representing sentence structure helping to select appropriate translations and providing confidence estimates for different interpretations, enabling highlighting of uncertain translations for human review. Information extraction requires understanding relationships between entities to extract structured information about who did what to whom, when, and where, where probabilistic graphical models capture these dependencies and provide uncertainty estimates about extracted information, enabling news aggregators to reconcile potentially conflicting reports from multiple sources. Voice assistant intent recognition handles ambiguous queries like "Book a table for two" that could mean restaurant reservations or furniture arrangements, where structured models use conversation context and user history to estimate intent probabilities, asking clarifying questions when uncertainty is high rather than guessing incorrectly.

\subsection{Social Media Network Analysis}

Social media networks provide rich examples of how deep learning and graph neural networks are applied to understand complex social structures and behaviors. In social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, GNNs are used to model user interactions, content propagation, and community detection, where the graph structure represents users as nodes and relationships like friendships, follows, or interactions as edges. These models can predict user behavior, identify influential users, detect fake news propagation, and recommend relevant content by learning representations that capture both individual user characteristics and their position within the social network structure.

\subsection{Value of Structured Models}

Structured models provide several key advantages including interpretability where the model structure reflects domain knowledge and causal relationships, enabling users to understand how the model makes decisions and what factors influence the predictions. Uncertainty quantification provides principled probability estimates that are crucial for decision-making in high-stakes applications, where knowing not just what the model predicts but how confident it is in that prediction can be the difference between success and failure. Data efficiency is achieved through structure that reduces parameters and sample complexity, where the explicit modeling of dependencies allows the model to learn more effectively from limited data. Reasoning capabilities enable inference, prediction, and decision-making under uncertainty, where the structured approach allows the model to handle complex scenarios that would be difficult for unstructured models.

These applications show how structured probabilistic models provide principled frameworks for dealing with uncertainty in safety-critical and high-stakes applications.
