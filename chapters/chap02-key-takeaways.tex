\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em]
    \item \textbf{Vectors and matrices} are fundamental building blocks for representing data and transformations in neural networks.
    \item \textbf{Matrix operations} (multiplication, transposition, inversion) enable efficient computation of forward passes and gradients.
    \item \textbf{Eigendecomposition and SVD} reveal structure in data and are crucial for PCA, matrix factorisation, and understanding dynamics.
    \item \textbf{Norms and distances} provide metrics for measuring similarity, regularisation, and convergence in optimisation.
    \item \textbf{Linear systems} underpin many machine learning algorithms and their solvability determines model identifiability.
