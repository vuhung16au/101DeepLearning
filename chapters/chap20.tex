Generative models are machine learning systems that learn to create new data samples that resemble a given dataset. For example, after training on thousands of cat photos, a generative model can produce entirely new, realistic cat images that never existed before.

Think of generative models as digital artists who study masterpieces to understand artistic style, then create original works in that same style. Just as a painter learns brushstrokes and color palettes from studying great works, these models learn the underlying patterns and structures in data to generate novel samples.

Generative models learn data distributions in complementary ways: explicit likelihoods, implicit adversarial training, or score-based diffusion. Each chooses a tractable learning signal that captures structure while managing complexity.
