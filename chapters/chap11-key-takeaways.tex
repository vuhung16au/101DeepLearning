    \item \textbf{Start simple}: Establish a reliable baseline to validate data, metrics, and training code.
    \item \textbf{Measure relentlessly}: Use clear validation splits, confidence intervals, and learning curves.
    \item \textbf{Ablate to learn}: Prefer small, controlled changes to isolate causal effects.
    \item \textbf{Prioritise data}: Label quality, coverage, and augmentation often beat model complexity.
    \item \textbf{Tune methodically}: Track hyperparameters, seeds, and environments for reproducibility.
    \item \textbf{Deploy with monitoring}: Watch for drift, performance decay, and fairness regressions; plan periodic re-training.
