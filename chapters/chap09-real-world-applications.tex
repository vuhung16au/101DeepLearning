\label{sec:cnn-real-world}

Convolutional neural networks have revolutionized how computers understand images and videos, transforming abstract computer vision research into practical tools that improve healthcare, safety, and daily convenience. Their applications touch nearly every aspect of modern visual technology, from medical diagnosis to autonomous vehicles and everyday smartphone features.

\subsection{Medical Image Analysis}

CNNs help doctors diagnose diseases more accurately and quickly, revolutionizing medical imaging across multiple specialties. Cancer detection in radiology represents one of the most impactful applications, where CNNs analyze X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs to detect tumors often invisible to the human eye. Mammography systems using CNNs can spot breast cancer earlier than traditional methods, potentially saving thousands of lives annually by learning to recognize subtle patterns that indicate malignancy.

Diabetic retinopathy screening demonstrates how CNNs can democratize healthcare access, examining photos of patients' eyes to detect diabetes-related damage before vision loss occurs. This allows automated screening in remote areas without specialist ophthalmologists, making eye care accessible to millions more people worldwide. Skin cancer classification through smartphone apps represents another accessible application, allowing people to photograph suspicious moles for instant preliminary assessment, encouraging early medical consultation when something looks concerning.\index{applications!medical imaging}

\subsection{Autonomous Driving}

Self-driving cars rely on CNNs to understand their surroundings, requiring real-time processing of complex visual information under varied conditions. Object detection and tracking systems process camera feeds to identify pedestrians, other vehicles, traffic signs, and lane markings in real-time, working perfectly under challenging conditions including rain, snow, nighttime, and construction zones where lives depend on accurate perception.

Depth estimation capabilities enable CNNs to analyze images and determine how far away objects are, helping vehicles make safe decisions about braking, turning, and merging. This works effectively even with regular cameras, though it's enhanced when combined with other sensors. Semantic segmentation provides pixel-level understanding by labeling every pixel in the camera view as road, sidewalk, vehicle, sky, etc., giving the vehicle complete environmental understanding that enables precise navigation.\index{applications!autonomous vehicles}
