\section{Production Considerations \difficultyInline{intermediate}}
\label{sec:production}

\subsection{Model Deployment}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Model compression (pruning, quantization) to meet latency/size budgets
    \item Model serving infrastructure (A/B testing, canary deploys)
    \item Latency budgets and tail performance (p95/p99)
    \item Batch vs. online inference and feature freshness
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Monitoring}

Track in production:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Prediction distribution shifts (covariate/label shift) \index{distribution shift}
    \item Model performance metrics and calibration drift
    \item System latency and throughput; autoscaling behavior
    \item Error analysis with human-in-the-loop review
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Iterative Improvement}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Deploy initial model
    \item Monitor performance
    \item Collect more data
    \item Retrain and improve
    \item A/B test new models
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Applications and context}

Compression and low-latency serving are crucial in mobile vision, speech on device, and recommender systems; calibration and post-deployment monitoring are critical in healthcare and finance \textcite{Ronneberger2015,Prince2023}.
