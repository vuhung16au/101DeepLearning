% Chapter 7: Regularization for Deep Learning

\chapter{Regularization for Deep Learning}
\label{chap:regularization}

This chapter explores techniques to improve generalization and prevent overfitting in deep neural networks. Regularization helps models perform well on unseen data.


\begin{learningobjectives}
\objective{Why regularization is needed and how it improves generalization}
\objective{Norm penalties (L1, L2, Elastic Net) and identify when to use each}
\objective{Data augmentation strategies across vision, text, and audio tasks}
\objective{Early stopping and understand its interaction with optimization}
\objective{Dropout and normalization layers and reason about their effects}
\objective{Advanced techniques such as label smoothing, mixup, adversarial training, and gradient clipping}
\end{learningobjectives}
