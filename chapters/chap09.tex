% Chapter 9: Convolutional Networks

\chapter{Convolutional Networks}
\label{chap:convolutional-networks}

This chapter introduces convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are particularly effective for processing grid-structured data like images. We build intuition first, then progressively add mathematical detail and modern algorithms, with historical context and key takeaways throughout \cite{GoodfellowEtAl2016,Prince2023}.

\begin{learningobjectives}
\objective{The intuition of convolution, pooling, and receptive fields and how they induce translation equivariance and parameter sharing}
\objective{Output shapes and parameter counts for common layer configurations (kernel size, stride, padding, channels)}
\objective{Core CNN algorithms: convolution/cross-correlation, pooling, backpropagation through convolution, and residual connections}
\objective{Classic architectures (LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, Inception, ResNet, MobileNet/EfficientNet) and their design trade-offs}
\objective{CNNs to key tasks in vision: classification, detection, and segmentation, and choose appropriate heads and losses}
\objective{Historical milestones that motivated CNN advances and understand why techniques were developed}
\end{learningobjectives}
