# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Deep Learning 101


## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive LaTeX book on Deep Learning with advanced features including glossary, index, and difficulty levels. The book is structured as a complete educational resource with 20 chapters covering fundamentals to advanced research topics.

## Language and Locale Policies

### Language Style
- **Use British English** for all content, comments, and documentation (not American English)
- Examples of British English spelling:
  - Use "colour" not "color"
  - Use "optimise" not "optimize"
  - Use "behaviour" not "behavior"
  - Use "centre" not "center"
  - Use "analyse" not "analyze"

### Locale and Date Formatting
- **Locale**: Use `en-GB` as the standard locale
- **Date Format**: Use English date format: `14 Oct 2025` (day-month-year with abbreviated month)
- **LaTeX Configuration**: The document uses `\usepackage[en-GB]{datetime2}` and `\DTMsetstyle{en-GB}` for consistent date formatting

### Units of Measurement
- **Use metric units** for all measurements in examples and content (not imperial units)
- **Length/Height**: Use centimetres (cm) or metres (m), not feet or inches
  - Example: "170 cm, 170.5 cm, 170.52 cm" not "5.7 feet, 5.73 feet, 5.732 feet"
- **Temperature**: Use degrees Celsius (¬∞C), not Fahrenheit (¬∞F)
  - Example: "22.3¬∞C, 22.34¬∞C, 22.341¬∞C" not "72.3¬∞F, 72.34¬∞F, 72.341¬∞F"
- **Weight/Mass**: Use kilograms (kg) or grams (g), not pounds or ounces
- **Exception**: Metaphorical or idiomatic uses of imperial terms (e.g., "feel the slope under your feet") are acceptable as they are not measurements

## Color Scheme Policy

The book uses a consistent color scheme throughout for visual identity and readability:

### Primary Colors
- **Purple**: RGB(60, 16, 83), Hex: #3C1053 - Used for main accents, links, and theorem boxes
- **Red**: RGB(242, 18, 12), Hex: #F2120C - Used for citations and emphasis
- **Black**: RGB(0, 0, 0), Hex: #000000 - Standard text color
- **White**: RGB(255, 255, 255), Hex: #FFFFFF - Background color

### Secondary Colors
- **Law Purple**: RGB(181, 24, 37), Hex: #B51825 - Faculty of Law and Business accent
- **Warm Stone**: RGB(145, 139, 131), Hex: #918B83 - Neutral accent for backgrounds
- **Deep Charcoal**: RGB(48, 44, 42), Hex: #302C2A - Dark neutral for text variants
- **Soft Ivory**: RGB(242, 239, 235), Hex: #F2EFEB - Light background for boxes

### Color Usage Guidelines
- Use primary colors for main structural elements
- Use secondary colors for subtle accents and backgrounds
- Maintain sufficient contrast for readability
- Exercise boxes use separate color coding (green/blue/red for easy/medium/hard)

## Paper Margin Policy

The book uses standardised margins for both A4 and A5 paper sizes to ensure optimal readability and binding:

### A4 Paper Margins
- **Top margin**: 2cm (good for headers)
- **Bottom margin**: 2cm (good for footers)
- **Inner margin**: 1.8cm (left margin for binding)
- **Outer margin**: 1.5cm (right margin)

### A5 Paper Margins
- **Left margin**: 1.8cm (inner margin for binding)
- **Right margin**: 1.5cm (outer margin)
- **Top margin**: 2cm (space for headers)
- **Bottom margin**: 2cm (space for footers)

### LaTeX Implementation
The margins are configured using the geometry package in `main.tex`:
```latex
% \papersize is a custom command defined earlier: \providecommand{\papersize}{a5paper}
% It allows dynamic paper size selection (a4paper or a5paper)
\usepackage[\papersize, top=2cm, bottom=2cm, inner=1.8cm, outer=1.5cm]{geometry}
```

### Important Notes
- The same margin values are used for both A4 and A5 papers
- `inner` margin refers to the binding edge (left on odd pages, right on even pages)
- `outer` margin refers to the outer edge (right on odd pages, left on even pages)
- These margins are optimised for two-sided printing with `twoside` document class option
- Do not modify margin settings without explicit authorisation as they affect print quality and binding

## Key Features to Maintain

### 1. Glossary and Index System
- **Glossary**: Technical terms are defined in `chapters/glossary.tex`
- **Usage**: Use `\gls{term}` for first occurrence of glossary terms
- **Index**: Use `\index{term}` or `\index{term!subterm}` for hierarchical indexing
- **Build Process**: Glossary and index are automatically processed during compilation

### 2. Difficulty Levels
- **Inline rule**: Difficulty markers (üí´/‚≠ê/üåü) MUST appear inline with the heading text, never on a new line.
  - Example: `6.2 Activation Functions ‚≠ê`
- **Command**: Prefer `\\difficultyInline{level}` inside the section title; legacy `\\difficulty{level}` is deprecated.
- **Levels**: 
  - `beginner` - Basic concepts, intuitive explanations (displays as üí´)
  - `intermediate` - Technical details, some background assumed (displays as ‚≠êÔ∏è)
  - `advanced` - Cutting-edge research, complex mathematics (displays as üåü)
- **Visual**: Emoji indicators appear next to section titles on the same line
- **Implementation**: The LaTeX preamble provides `\\difficultyInline{}` for headings; do not put difficulty on a separate line

### 3. LaTeX Structure
- **Main File**: `main.tex` contains document structure and packages
- **Chapters**: Each chapter in `chapters/chapXX.tex` includes sections
- **Sections**: Individual sections in `chapters/chapXX-secYY.tex`
- **Build**: Use `make clean && make pdf` for compilation

## Coding Guidelines

### LaTeX Best Practices
1. **Package Usage**: Use established packages (amsmath, hyperref, glossaries, makeidx)
2. **Cross-references**: Use `\label{}` and `\ref{}` for internal references
3. **Math**: Use proper mathematical notation with `\vect{}`, `\mat{}`, `\norm{}`
4. **Theorems**: Use defined environments (theorem, definition, example, etc.)
   - All theorem-like environments share the same counter per chapter
   - Numbering format: "Environment X.Y" where X is chapter number, Y is sequential
   - **Problems have their own separate numbering system**
5. **Algorithms**: Use `algorithm` and `algpseudocode` packages for all algorithms
   - Use `\begin{algorithm}...\end{algorithm}` for the outer container
   - Use `\begin{algorithmic}...\end{algorithmic}` for the pseudocode content
   - Use `\Require` and `\Ensure` for preconditions and postconditions
   - Use `\State`, `\If`, `\While`, `\For` and other algpseudocode commands for control structures
   - Algorithms are automatically numbered and can be cross-referenced with `\label{}` and `\ref{}`

### Content Structure
```latex
\section{Section Title \difficultyInline{beginner|intermediate|advanced}}
\label{sec:section-name}

% Content with glossary entries
\gls{neural-network} and \gls{backpropagation} are key concepts.

% Index entries
\index{deep learning!concepts}
\index{machine learning!neural networks}
```

### Glossary Entries
- Add new terms to `chapters/glossary.tex`
- Use clear, accessible definitions
- Match difficulty level of content
- Include mathematical notation when appropriate

### Index Entries
- Use hierarchical structure: `\index{main!subcategory}`
- Include both technical terms and conceptual topics
- Add entries throughout content, not just at section ends

### Algorithm Structure
```latex
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Algorithm Name}
\label{alg:algorithm-name}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Require $n \geq 0$ (description of input parameter)
\Ensure $y = x^n$ (description of output)
\State $y \gets 1$
\State $X \gets x$
\State $N \gets n$
\While{$N \neq 0$}
\If{$N$ is even}
    \State $X \gets X \times X$
    \State $N \gets \frac{N}{2}$  \Comment{This is a comment}
\ElsIf{$N$ is odd}
    \State $y \gets y \times X$
    \State $N \gets N - 1$
\EndIf
\EndWhile
\State \Return $y$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style
- Use clear, accessible language appropriate for difficulty level
- Provide intuitive explanations before mathematical details
- Include practical examples and applications
- Maintain consistent notation throughout

### Chapter Structure Requirements
- **Each chapter must have a brief introduction at the start**: A 1-2 paragraph overview that introduces the chapter's topic and provides context
- **Each chapter must have 15-20 Hands-On Exercises**: Practical exercises categorised by difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard) to reinforce learning
  - Use `\begin{problem}[Title]...\end{problem}` environment
  - Exercises have their own separate numbering system starting from 1 in each chapter (e.g., Exercise 1.1, Exercise 1.2, Exercise 2.1, Exercise 2.2)
  - Include hints for each exercise using `\textbf{Hint:}` formatting
  - Organise by difficulty level in subsections (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- **Each chapter must have a Key Takeaways section**: Use the boxed `keytakeaways` environment
  - Create a file named `chapters/chapXX-key-takeaways.tex`
  - Use `\begin{keytakeaways}...\end{keytakeaways}` with itemised key points
  - Include this file at the end of the chapter before exercises
  - Key Takeaways should be concise and to the point, focusing on the most important concepts and insights
  - Aim for 5 items per chapter as the standard, with flexibility to use 4-6 items

- **Summaries should use boxed format when present**: Use the `summary` environment
  - Use `\begin{summary}...\end{summary}` for chapter or section summaries
  - Both environments use tcolorbox for enhanced visual presentation

### Deep Learning Chapters Requirements
- **All deep learning chapters (6-20) must include a "Real World Applications" section**
- This section should:
  - Provide at least 3 concrete, practical examples
  - Focus on less technical, easy-to-understand explanations
  - Show how techniques solve real-world problems
  - Include proper index entries for applications

### Mathematical Content
- Provide step-by-step derivations for complex concepts
- Use appropriate mathematical notation
- Include visual aids (explanatory diagrams, plots, etc.) when helpful
- Ensure mathematical accuracy

### Code Examples
- Include practical, runnable code examples
- Use clear, well-commented code
- Provide expected outputs and explanations
- Match difficulty level of surrounding content

### Exercise Formatting
- **Environment**: Use `\begin{exercisebox}[difficulty]...\end{exercisebox}` to wrap exercises
- **Difficulty Levels**: Pass difficulty as parameter to exercisebox
  - `\begin{exercisebox}[easy]` for beginner-level exercises (light green background)
  - `\begin{exercisebox}[medium]` for intermediate exercises (light blue background)
  - `\begin{exercisebox}[hard]` for advanced exercises (light red/pink background)
- **Numbering**: Exercises have their own separate numbering system
  - Format: "Exercise X.Y" where X is the chapter number and Y is the sequential number starting from 1
  - Example: Exercise 1.1, Exercise 1.2, Exercise 1.3 (in Chapter 1)
  - Example: Exercise 2.1, Exercise 2.2, Exercise 2.3 (in Chapter 2)
  - Exercises are numbered independently from theorems, definitions, and examples
- **Structure**: Each exercise should include:
  - Outer `exercisebox` with difficulty level
  - Inner `\begin{problem}[Title]...\end{problem}` for the exercise content
  - `\begin{hintbox}...\end{hintbox}` for hints (separate from problem)
- **Organisation**: Group exercises by difficulty level using subsections:
  - `\subsection*{Easy}` for beginner-level exercises
  - `\subsection*{Medium}` for intermediate exercises
  - `\subsection*{Hard}` for advanced exercises

### Exercise Box Design
- **Visual Design**: Exercises use color-coded boxes for clear visual hierarchy
  - Easy exercises: Light green background (RGB 232,245,233)
  - Medium exercises: Light blue background (RGB 227,242,253)
  - Hard exercises: Light red/pink background (RGB 255,235,238)
- **Hint Boxes**: Hints are displayed in separate yellow boxes with orange borders
  - Automatic "Hint:" label
  - Italic text style for readability
  - Visually distinct from exercise content
- **Professional Appearance**: Subtle colors and minimal borders maintain academic tone
  - Rounded corners (3pt arc)
  - Thin borders (0.5pt)
  - Appropriate spacing before and after boxes

### Example Exercise Format
```latex
\subsection*{Easy}

\begin{exercisebox}[easy]
\begin{problem}[RNN vs Feedforward]
Explain why standard feedforward networks are not suitable for sequence modeling tasks.
