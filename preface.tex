\textbf{Preface}\\[1em]

Dear ML/AI learners,\\[0.5em]

Welcome to \textit{Deep Learning 101}, a comprehensive guide designed to take you from the fundamentals to advanced concepts in deep learning. This book is crafted for students, researchers, and practitioners who want to build a solid foundation in one of the most transformative fields of our time.\\[0.5em]

I started this book as study notes for myself, because I couldn't find any book that fit my background. As I delved deeper into the field, I realised that many existing resources were either too basic or too advanced, leaving a gap for learners with a technical foundation seeking comprehensive yet accessible coverage.\\[0.5em]

This book is a ``compressed version'' of the deep learning books out there---you'll find the most important concepts and mathematical formulae presented in a structured, coherent manner. Rather than overwhelming you with every detail, I've distilled the essential knowledge that forms the foundation of modern deep learning.\\[0.5em]

This book assumes you have a fair understanding of mathematics, algorithms, and programming. But don't worry---you'll learn along the way if you miss any of them. The early chapters provide mathematical foundations, and examples throughout the book will help reinforce concepts you may need to review.\\[0.5em]

The target audience includes those who want to learn the basics of deep learning with a focus on mathematics. If you're interested in research or want to dive a little deeper into the maths and algorithms underlying neural networks, this book will guide you through both theory and practice.\\[0.5em]

Whether you're just beginning your journey into machine learning or looking to deepen your understanding of neural networks, this book provides the mathematical foundations, practical insights, and hands-on knowledge you need to succeed.\\[0.5em]

I hope this resource serves you well in your learning journey.\\[1em]

Best regards,\\
Vu Hung Nguyen\\[1em]
